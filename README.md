Facilitating Creating Icons for Android and iOS Apps

The purpose of the code is to generate the icons of sizes needed for Android and iOS Apps.  You need to upload a picture, then the code will resize it to the designated sizes.  The easiest way to generate the base image is using powerpoint.

Since the code is hosted on Heroku and Heroku does not seem to allow user to access its file system, the resizing and .zip generation are all done in memory.
